We submitted a manuscript entitled “Identification of Key Genes and Pathways between Mild and Severe Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) by Integrative Analysis” for publication in PeerJ. Based on the dataset GSE49541, 57 DEGs were filtered when compared the gene profiles of livers in severe NAFLD with that in mild NAFLD. The gene ontology functional and pathway enrichment analyses of differentially-expressed genes were performed by the DAVID software followed by the construction of a protein-protein interaction network. Hub gene identification was performed by the plug-in cytoHubba in cytoscape software. Upregulated expression of five hub genes (SOX9, CCL20, CD24, CXCL1 and CHST4) were verified in the livers of steatosis mice and in the liver cell line HepG2 cells exposed to glucolipotoxicity condition. Our results offer new insights into NAFLD pathogenesis and progression, and might be helpful for disease diagnosis and drug discovery.
